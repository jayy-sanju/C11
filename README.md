In a decentralized payment system, trust is a critical element, especiallywhen parties involved don't know or trust each other. Fortunately, decentralized escrow protocols offer a reliable solution for parties tomake safe payments without the need for intermediaries. One of the popular decentralized escrow protocols is Eskro. This protocol enables parties to transact safely, knowing that their tokens are securely helduntil the conditions for payment are met. Before any transaction can take place, the tokens are sent to an escrow, which is a third-party smart contract that holds the tokens until the payment terms are satisfied. To ensure that both parties fulfill their obligations, both the product or service andthepayment must be made as agreed. This guarantees that one party can't back out of the deal at the expense of the other party. The Eskro protocol helps build trust among parties by ensuring that everyone fulfills their endof the deal, which is crucial in decentralized transactions. In some cases, the payment terms may depend on external information, such as whenaproduct is shipped. To address this, the oracle pattern can be utilizedtoprovide the escrow with the necessary information, allowing it to executethe transaction only when the conditions are met. Once the smart contract code is deployed on the blockchain, it becomes immutable, meaningit can't be changed. This feature ensures the safety and reliability of the escrow functionality, making it virtually impossible for any party to tamper with the transaction. This provides all parties involved withthepeace of mind that they won't be taken advantage of in the transaction. Overall, escrow protocols are an essential element of decentralized transactions, providing a secure and transparent way for parties toexchange goods or services without the need for a centralized intermediary.
